# CircleClock
A circle clock written in JS with p5.js

you can click to show the watch hands.
the other options are available in console or via the source code. A quick comment or uncomment will do the work.

to show options open console and type in: showOptions();
to hide the options, use: hideOptions();

this was mainly built just for fun and to have a template for an android live wallpaper.
I thought it would be possible to run JS on Live Wallpapers, but that is not the case. 
This means that i have to write the whole code in java again -.-*  :D
